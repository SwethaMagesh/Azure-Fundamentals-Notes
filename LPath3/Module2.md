## Module 2 has 8 units
### UNIT 1: Introduction
- **Prerequisites**
  - Familiarity with the concept of application programming interfaces, or APIs. Programmers use APIs to interact with the functionality that's contained in code libraries.
  - Familiarity with the following additional concepts:
    - **Web API**: An API that's accessible from servers that accept requests via HTTP.
    - **Web API endpoint**: The location of the code library.
    - **REST API**: The design of the URL style that's used to expose the API's functionality.

### UNIT 2: Identify the product options
-  A goal of AI is to create a software system that's able to adapt, or learn something on its own without being explicitly programmed to do it
- 2 approaches
  - The first is to employ a **deep learning system** 
    - that's modeled on the **neural network of the human mind**, enabling it to discover, learn, and grow through experience.
  - The second approach is **machine learning**,
    - a **data science technique that uses existing data** to train a model, test it, and then apply the model to new data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends.
 - SCOPE:  every device or software system that collects textual, visual, and audio data could feed a **machine learning model** that makes that device or software system **smarter** about how it functions in the future.
- **ML**
  - Data -> Train n test model -> _you can deploy and use it in real time via a **web API endpoint**_
  - Even after deploying, feedback or data helps to retune the model
- **Cognitive service**
  - prebuilt machine learning models that enable applications to see, hear, speak, understand, and even begin to reason.
  - Developers access Azure Cognitive Services via APIs and can easily include these features in just a few lines of code.
  - Eg: object recognition, face detection, image to text, sentiment analysis
  - No training data => direct **live data**
  - **Types**
  1. Language
  2. Speech
  3. Decision
  4. Vision
- **Bot service**
  - _**Azure Bot Service and Bot Framework**_ are platforms for creating virtual agents
  - uses other Azure services, such as Azure Cognitive Services, to understand what their human counterparts are asking for.
  - Users converse with a bot by using **text, interactive cards, and speech**
  - _can be a sophisticated conversation that intelligently provides access to services._
