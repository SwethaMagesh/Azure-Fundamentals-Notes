## Module 3 - has 7 units
- **Prerequisites**
	- An understanding of the concepts of orchestration, workflows, and application programming interfaces (API)
	- High-level familiarity with relevant Microsoft products such as _**Dynamics 365 and Office 365**_

### Unit 1: Intro
- Event driven
- You never have to worry about an outage, your code can **scale instantly to meet demand**, and you pay based only on the actual usage of your code.
---
### Unit 2: Identify product options
-  Apps to respond to events. An event could be a **REST endpoint, a periodic timer, or even a message received from another Azure service**
-  SCOPE: back-end scenarios or background task like messaging etc. **not user facing scenarios**
-  PL support:  C#, Python, JavaScript, Typescript, Java, and PowerShell
-  Scale automatic, only billed for usage => **perfect choice for variable demand**
-  eg:  For example, you might be receiving messages from an **IoT solution** that monitors a fleet of delivery vehicles.

-  Ideal when you're concerned only with the code that's running your service and not the underlying platform or infrastructure.
-  Ideal when job is in response to event and runs in small time like seconds or less
-  STATELESS
-  STATEFUL => 
	-  needs storage accnt
	-  can orchestration tasks by using an extension called Durable functions
		-  chain functions together while maintaining state.
